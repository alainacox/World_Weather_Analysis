# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of the Analysis is to help Jack answer the question: How might we provide real-time suggestions for our client's ideal hotels?
First task is to define what you meant by "ideal." Narrowed the data to hotels that were (1) within a given range of latitude and longitude and that (2) provided the right kind of weather for the client

To do this I did the following:

  1. Collected the Data
  
        	City, country, and date
      
        	Latitude and longitude
      
        	Maximum temperature
      
        	Humidity
      
        	Cloudiness
      
        	Wind speed
      
         Current Weather Description

   2. Exploratory Analysis with Visualization of 
   
      scatter plots of the weather data
      correlations for the weather data
      heatmaps using the Google Maps and Places API
